# The-Enigma-Machine
A more simple implementation of the Enigma Machine from World War II, which the solution of its encryption 
was a boost to the beginning of the CS field.
in this implementation, there are rotors and a reflector (in the original machine there were also plugs).
please read here for how it is implemented: http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/howitworks.html (ignore the plug-board)

*there is also a main with a small example of usage.
